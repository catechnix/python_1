Unit testing: 
Unit testing is the process of verifying that a unit works correctly
A unit is a function, method, class or module
The verification is donee through assertions
An assertion compares an expected result to an actual result obtained by the unit under test
If the results don't match, the test fails
A unit test is a piece of code that performs and automates these verifications

Good unit tests should:
test all possible path
not depend on or affect the environment
be runnable on their own
alway
